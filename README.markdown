Homedir
========

A mostly complete listing of my home directory. SSH aliases and other private scripts are missing.

Things of most interest:

* Vimrc

	* Well organized and well commented
	
	* Interesting plugins: Taglist, NERDTree, FuzzyFinder

* Bash profile/rc (reasonably organized)

	* Reasonably organized
	
* Other random things

	* django, svn bash completion script
	
	* input.rc has this cool hack I use to scroll through my history
	
	* Bash, git, svn alias and tricks?
