Homedir
========

My public facing homedir, lovingly grown over many years and lots of wasted time. I often get more wrapped up in the process of tweaking things versus actually completing things!

Areas of interest:

* .bin/ 
	* Random scripts I've written and collected
	* youtube-dl - download youtube videos
	* prettyJSON.py - format JSON
	* findr.sh - makes GNU find much more useful for most situations
	* cloc.pl - SLOC analyzer

* .vim/ and .vimrc
	* Reasonably organized, well commented vimrc. Vim is my main IDE, so I'm always tweaking vim.
	* NERDTree - good filesystem browser
	* taglist - essential source code browser
	* fuzzyfinder - similar to textmate's fuzzy file finder, this is a hack of ruby scripts and fuzzyfinder vim plugin. great for finding files!
	
* .bash_profile and .bashrc
	* .bash_profile should be loaded first, sets up the ENV and PATH
	* .bashrc sets ENV variables and settings, loads other customizations
	* .bash_aliases is shorter scripts and command aliases
	* .bash_machines is shortcuts to all my machines
	* input.rc has some cool hacks for viewing history and setting up the terminal
