" Version: 2.3
" Last Modified: June 3, 2006
"
" Overview
" --------
" The Most Recently Used (MRU) plugin provides an easy access to a list of
" recently opened/edited files in Vim. This plugin automatically stores the
" file names as you open/edit them in Vim.
"
" This plugin will work on all the platforms where Vim is supported. This
" plugin will work in both console and GUI Vim.
"
" The recently used filenames are stored in a file specified by the Vim
" MRU_File variable.
"
" Installation
" ------------
" 1. Copy the mru.vim script to the $HOME/.vim/plugin or the
"    $HOME/vimfiles/plugin or the $VIM/vimfiles directory.  Refer to the
"    ':help add-plugin', ':help add-global-plugin' and ':help runtimepath'
"    topics for more details about Vim plugins.
" 2. Set the MRU_File Vim variable in the .vimrc file to the location of a
"    file to store the most recently edited file names.
" 3. Restart Vim.
" 4. You can use the ":MRU" command to list and edit the recently used files.
"    In GUI Vim, you can use the 'File->Recent Files' menu to access the
"    recently used files.
"
" Usage
" -----
" You can use the ":MRU" command to list all the most recently edited file
" names. The file names will be listed in a temporary Vim window. If the MRU
" window is already opened, then the MRU list displayed in the window will be
" refreshed.
"
" If you are using GUI Vim, then the names of the recently edited files are
" added to the "File->Recent Files" menu. You can select the name of a file
" from this sub-menu to edit the file.
"
" You can use the normal Vim commands to move around the MRU window. You
" cannot make changes in the MRU window.
"
" You can select a file name to edit by pressing the <Enter> key or by double
" clicking the left mouse button on a file name.  The selected file will be
" opened.
"
" You can press the 'o' key to open the file name under the cursor in the
" MRU window in a new window.
"
" You can press the 'u' key in the MRU window to update the file list. This is
" useful if you keep the MRU window open.
"
" You can close the MRU window by pressing the 'q' key or using one of the Vim
" window commands.
"
" You can use the ":MRUedit" command to edit files from the MRU list. This
" command supports completion of file names from the MRU list. You can specify
" the file either by the name or by the location in the MRU list.
"
" Whenever the MRU list changes, the MRU file is updated with the latest MRU
" list. When you have multiple instances of Vim running at the same time, the
" latest MRU list will show up in all the instances of Vim.
"
" Configuration
" -------------
" By changing the following variables you can configure the behavior of this
" plugin. Set the following variables in your .vimrc file using the 'let'
" command.
"
" The list of recently edit file names is stored in the file specified by the
" MRU_File variable.  The default setting for this variable is
" $HOME/.vim_mru_files for Unix systems and $VIM/_vim_mru_files for non-Unix
" systems. You can change this variable to point to a file by adding the
" following line to the .vimrc file:
"
"       let MRU_File = 'd:\myhome\_vim_mru_files'
"
" By default, the plugin will remember the names of the last 10 used files.
" As you edit more files, old file names will be removed from the MRU list.
" You can set the 'MRU_Max_Entries' variable to remember more file names. For
" example, to remember 20 most recently used file names, you can use
"
"       let MRU_Max_Entries = 20
"
" By default, all the edited file names will be added to the MRU list. If you
" want to exclude file names matching a list of patterns, you can set the
" MRU_Exclude_Files variable to a list of Vim regular expressions. By default,
" this variable is set to an empty string. For example, to not include files
" in the temporary (/tmp, /var/tmp and d:\temp) directories, you can set the
" MRU_Exclude_Files variable to
"
"       let MRU_Exclude_Files = '^/tmp/.*\|^/var/tmp/.*'  " For Unix
"       let MRU_Exclude_Files = '^c:\\temp\\.*'           " For MS-Windows
" 
" The specified pattern should be a Vim regular expression pattern.
"
" The default height of the MRU window is 8. You can set the MRU_Window_Height
" variable to change the window height.
"
"       let MRU_Window_Height = 15
"
" By default, when the :MRU command is invoked, the MRU list will be displayed
" in a new window. Instead, if you want the MRU plugin to reuse the current
" window, then you can set the 'MRU_Use_Current_Window' variable to one.
"
"       let MRU_Use_Current_Window = 1
"
" The MRU plugin will reuse the current window. When a file name is selected,
" the file is also opened in the current window.
"
" When you select a file from the MRU window, the MRU window will be
" automatically closed and the selected file will be opened in the previous
" window. You can set the 'MRU_Auto_Close' variable to zero to keep the MRU
" window open.
"
"       let MRU_Auto_Close = 0
